# Asynchronous-Job-Scheduler-with-Kernel-Thread-Pool
Implemented an asynchronous multithreaded producer-consumer priority queuing mechanism which queues jobs by producers in a shared data structure from where consumers can fetch and process them asynchronously. Callbacks from kernel to user space was implemented using netlink sockets. The mechanism supports encryption/decryption, compression/decompression, checksum and concatenation.
